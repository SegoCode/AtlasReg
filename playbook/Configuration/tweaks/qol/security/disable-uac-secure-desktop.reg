Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

; Disables switching to the Secure Desktop when prompting for elevation. An application would need admin privileges to control the mouse and keyboard to accept the UAC prompt anyways. As a note, UAC is not designed to save you from malware, UAC can easily be bypassed on admin accounts (e.g. check GitHub)

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]
"PromptOnSecureDesktop"=dword:00000000
